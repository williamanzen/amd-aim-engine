Implement multi-tenancy support with proper resource isolation, quota management, billing integration, and namespace-based separation for enterprise environments.

Requirements:
- Add namespace-based tenant isolation and management
- Implement resource quotas and limits per tenant
- Create billing and cost allocation mechanisms
- Add tenant-specific configuration and policy management
- Implement proper security isolation between tenants
- Add support for tenant onboarding and lifecycle management
- Design for scalable multi-tenant operations

Expected Deliverables:
- Namespace-based tenant isolation and resource management
- Comprehensive quota and limit enforcement mechanisms
- Billing integration and cost allocation reporting
- Tenant-specific policy and configuration management
- Security isolation and access control per tenant
- Tenant lifecycle management and automation

Testing Strategy:
- Unit tests for tenant isolation and quota enforcement
- Integration tests with multiple tenant scenarios
- Security isolation validation between tenants
- Resource allocation and billing accuracy tests
- Tenant lifecycle management testing

Key Implementation Details:
- Implement proper namespace isolation with network policies
- Add support for hierarchical resource quotas and limits
- Design for accurate cost tracking and allocation
- Implement tenant-specific policy enforcement
- Add support for self-service tenant management
- Include comprehensive audit logging for compliance

This step enables enterprise multi-tenancy with proper isolation and management capabilities.

## üéØ Prompt Generation Guidelines

### Prompt Structure
Each implementation step should be converted into a detailed prompt following this structure:

1. **Context Setting**: Clear description of the current state and what needs to be built
2. **Requirements**: Specific functional and technical requirements
3. **Implementation Details**: Key technical considerations and architectural decisions
4. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive testing approach for the component
5. **Integration Points**: How this component connects with existing code
6. **Success Criteria**: Clear definition of completion and validation

### Test-Driven Development Focus
Every prompt should emphasize:
- Writing tests first before implementation
- Comprehensive test coverage for edge cases
- Integration testing with existing components
- Performance and reliability testing
- Clear validation criteria for success

### Code Quality Standards
All prompts should enforce:
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Proper documentation and code comments
- Following Go best practices and idioms
- Implementing proper resource cleanup
- Adding comprehensive observability

### Integration Requirements
Each prompt must ensure:
- No orphaned or disconnected code
- Proper integration with previous components
- Clear interfaces and abstractions
- Backward compatibility considerations
- Future extensibility planning
